image::presentataion_pic.png[,80%] 

== About The Data 

* We have used 230 million recoreds from bus sensors within Dublin, between July 2017 to September 2018, as a stream data. 

* we have used TripAdvisor attractions' ratings that we scrapped from their website. 

* We matched these attractions data with attractions from the open data Irland website: data.gov.ie/[link]. +  

* We also used bus stops data that contain the geo location for each bus stop in Dublin. This data was downloaded from Smart Dublin website: https://data.smartdublin.ie/dataset/gtfs-r-real-time-passenger-information/[link]. +  

== About The Technology 
_Apache_Spark_(TM) and _Jupyter_Notebook_ as processing frameworks, and _Elasticsearch_ as datawarehouse. 

== About The Requirements & Usage 
* Processing is accomplished by using Spark 2.4.5 (PySpark) and Python 3.7.5.
* Please look at the 'Requirements.txt' file for required libraries. 
* Instructions below assumes that the code will run on _Databricks_. 
* Since we use _Elasticsearch_, in order to run the code you will need to write the following command on your VM cmd: 'sudo docker-compose up -d'
* Code is written as if we read stream from Kafka server, look at the cell 'read stream data' in 'final_app.ipynb'. 

=== Final Task 
In order to use the app (as a user) please enter the dashboard: XXXXX/[AppDashboard]. + and follow the instructions. 

In order to run the app code, please run the following files in the following order: 
1. 'attractions_schema_matching_using_NLP_methods.ipynb' 
2. 'create_all_static_data_dfs.ipynb' 
3. 'final_app.ipynb' 
	Notice: this file includes code to create and upload to 			_Elasticsearch_ the Delay stream data. Please type your 			_Elasticsearch_ host number in the _imports_ cell. 

In order to run the final app you are requested to choose _one_ of the options at the top of the notebook: 
* For Stream Sources, enter your api in the "API" option.
* For Batch Sources, enter your json path in the "Json path" option.
* For a single source, choose one of the bus stops options presented in the "Source Bus Stop" option.

The input data must include the same df columns as described in the 'final_app.ipynb' in the cell 'dublin data schema'. 


=== Warm up 
In order to run the Warm Up part, please run all files in the _warmup_task_ directory in the following order: 
1. 'preprocess_n_save_external_data.ipynb'
2. 'train_lr_model_task_2.ipynb' 
3. 'train_lr_task_3.ipynb' 
4. 'warmup_final.ipynb'
